FOUNDRY VTT NOTES:
The data layout can be a bit confusing, the whole document piece is to facilitate the data base management and most of the time you can ignore it. 
The one case where it can bite you is when you do fromUuid(uuid) you get back the document version of the object. 
For tokens the tokens document class is TokenDocument, for actors and items it is Actor and Item - hence the special casing for token documents (sometimes).
Foundry store lots of references from one thing to another to make navigation easy.

So actor.items.getName("Longsword").parent will get you back to where you started.  
It's generally not copies but references to the object and there is only one copy of the object. 
actor.data, item.data is the actual data for the object and actor.data._source is the information stored in the database. 
[Some of the data in the actor/item is always calculated when the actor/item is updated and never store in the data base]

The labels are not a great thing to match on, since they are localised to the language the game is run in and hence can change.

CONSOLE NOTES:
For the console _token refers to the currently selected token. 
So you can do _token.actor to look at the actor data, then navigate through _token.actor.data.data to get to what you want, so
_token.actor.data.data.details.type will get the actor type field.

JAVASCRIPT NOTES:
There is a javascript shorthand that is very useful for such things ternary operator at https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-ternary-operator/
(!([creatureType?.value.toLowerCase(), creatureType?.subtype.toLowerCase()].includes(activationCondition?.toLowerCase()))) {
    console.log ("MACRO TEST | REMOVE TARGET: %O %s", target, creatureType);
    workflow.targets.delete(target);
}
you don't need the if/else construction.
The ? short circuits the lookup and the result ends up being [undefined, undefined].includes(string) which is false, which is what you want, 
since it then takes the not of that expression, so the if(expr) evaluates to true.

Array iterators are very powerful, the if else chain for the crDestroy can be replaced with a one liner
    crDestroy = [{level: 17, cr: 4}, {level: 14,cr: 3}, {level: 11., cr:2}, {level: 8, cr: 1}, {level: 5, cr: 0.5}].find(l => actorClass.levels >= l.level).cr;

also worth looking at 
.map        https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_map.asp       for each element in the array do something
.filter     https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_filter.asp    create new array of all elements of the original array that pass a test 
.reduce     https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_reduce.asp    goes through an array and performs a function resulting in a singular value for the whole array

The normal route to access actor data from a token would be:   token.actor.data.data (avoid going via _source)




if you change workflow.damageRoll, you need to also update workflow.damageTotal and workflow.damageHTML. 
You should not be changing any _fields in the roll. 

damageHTML is set via workflow.damageHTML = await workflow.damageRoll.render().

Fiddling with the dice results is not a good solution, since you end up with a "bad" state in the roll, 
which is likely to cause problems. The way I'd recommend is to reroll the damage roll 
(behind the scenes with the correct formula - they player will never know) - you can fiddle with the roll 
before it is rolled, but not really after.



const newRoll = workflow.damageRoll.clone();
newRoll.dice.forEach(t=>t.modifiers.push("min2"));
workflow.damageRoll = await newRoll.roll();
workflow.damageTotal = newRoll.total;
workflow.damageHTML = await newRoll.render();
